# Nature Inspired Computing Project: Nonogram Solving

Nonograms are puzzles where you fill in cells in a grid based on the numbers given on the sides of the grid (clues).
This repository contains implementations of a nonogram solver using a genetic algorithm.
Solver attempts to solve a given Nonogram puzzle, by saving the validity of row clues during all generations. Mutation and crossover produces only valid solutions.
