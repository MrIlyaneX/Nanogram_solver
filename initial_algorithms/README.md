### This folder represent initial ideas of genetic algorithms: Code could appear not in the best practices. Code saved to obtain a possibility for comparison of initial approaches, final solution.

1. List-based representation: Each individual in the population is represented as a list of lists, where each sublist represents a row or column in the grid.

2. Bit string representation: Each individual in the population is represented as a bit string, where each bit represents a cell in the grid.

- This implementation has issues with the correct fitness calculation
- This approach is harder to maintain compared to list-based one
